# NYC Yellow Taxi Trip Data - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## üìå **Objective**

This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using a dataset of yellow taxi rides in New York City. The goal is to understand the significance of EDA in the broader context of data science and machine learning, particularly how it aids in uncovering patterns, cleaning data, and generating valuable insights.

## üîç **Tasks Performed**

To complete this assignment, the following steps were undertaken:

- **Data Loading**  
  Imported the NYC yellow taxi trip dataset into the analysis environment.

- **Data Cleaning**  
  Handled missing values, removed outliers, and ensured the data was in a usable format for analysis.

- **Exploratory Analysis: Bivariate and Multivariate**  
  Explored relationships between key variables to uncover meaningful patterns and trends.

- **Creating Visualizations**  
  Used graphs and plots to support the analysis and enhance interpretability.

- **Deriving Insights and Stating Conclusions**  
  Summarized key takeaways from the data to support recommendations for improving taxi operations.
